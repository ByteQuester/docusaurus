# DNS-DOCS-001 — Update debugging report and docs

- Status: Planned
- Dependencies: DNS-VALIDATE-001

## Steps

- Move the ad-hoc `debugging_report.md` to `tasks/incidents/debugging_report_dns.md` and update with final root cause and resolution.
- Add a short “DNS Triage Runbook” section to `docs/docs/runbooks.md` linking to these tasks.

## Acceptance

- Incident write-up updated and properly filed; runbook contains quick steps for next time.

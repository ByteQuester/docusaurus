# How to Create New Documentation

:::info This guide explains the process and conventions for creating new documentation for this project. Following these steps will ensure your new documents are correctly formatted and integrated into the site. :::

## 1. File Creation

Create your new documentation file as a Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) inside the appropriate subdirectory of the `docs` folder. For example, a new guide would be placed in a directory like `docs/guides-new/`.

## 2. Frontmatter

The frontmatter is the block of YAML at the very top of your markdown file. It provides important metadata about the document.

Here is the required frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
id: my-new-doc-id
slug: /url-for-my-new-doc
sidebar_position: 5
---
```

- **`id`**: This is a unique identifier for your document.

  - **Convention**: The `id` **must** match the filename (without the `.mdx` or `.md` extension). For example, if your file is named `my-new-doc-id.md`, the `id` must be `my-new-doc-id`.

- **`slug`**: This determines the URL of your page.

  - It can be different from the `id`.
  - It should start with a `/`.

- **`sidebar_position`**: This number determines the order of the document in the sidebar. Lower numbers appear higher up.

## 3. Content Formatting

Use Docusaurus and MDX features to make your content clear, readable, and engaging.

### Admonitions

Use admonitions to highlight important information.

| Type | Usage | Example - |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:::note` | For highlighting neutral or important information. | `:::note` <br/> This is a note. <br/> `:::` - |
| `:::tip` | For helpful tips and advice. | `:::tip` <br/> This is a tip. <br/> `:::` - |
| `:::info` | For general information that is good to know. | `:::info` <br/> This is for your information. <br/> `:::` - |
| `:::warning` | For warnings about potential issues or manual steps. | `:::warning` <br/> This is a warning. <br/> `:::` - |
| `:::danger` | For critical warnings about security risks or destructive actions. | `:::danger` <br/> This is a danger warning. <br/> `:::` - |

### Titled Code Blocks

To add a title to a code block (like a file path), use the `title` attribute after the language specifier.

**Example:**

````markdown
```bash title="/apps/my-new-service/package.json"
{
  "name": "my-new-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  ...
}
```
````

### Tabs

Use tabs to show information for different platforms or contexts (e.g., GCP vs. AWS).

**Example:**

```markdown
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'; import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gcp" label="GCP">
    GCP-specific content here.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aws" label="AWS">
    AWS-specific content here.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## 4. Sidebar Integration

If you place your new document in a directory that is configured for autogenerated sidebars (like our `guides-new` directory), it will be added to the sidebar automatically.

If you need to add it to a manual sidebar, you will need to edit `sidebars.ts` and add a reference to your document's `id` in the correct format (e.g., `'directory-name/doc-id'`).

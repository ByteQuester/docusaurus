# RESET-DOCS-LINKS â€” Capture decisions and templates

- Status: Planned

## Steps

- Document the reset decision and the temporary simplifications in `docs/docs/observability.md` and/or `docs/docs/security.md`.
- Note the future toggle to move back to manifest-managed SAs and stricter policies.

## Acceptance

- Docs capture the minimal reset approach and how to roll forward to the stricter baseline later.
